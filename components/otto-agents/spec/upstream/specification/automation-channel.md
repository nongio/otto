# Automation Catalogue Channel

<StabilityIndex level="1.0" />

The automation catalogue channel synchronizes every durable automation
definition visible to a client. Automations launch fresh agent sessions manually
or from host-owned triggers.

## URI

```text
ahp-automations://
```

Each `AutomationEntry.resource` is a stable `ahp-automation:/<id>` identifier
chosen by `automation/createRequested`. Those identifiers target commands,
actions, and relationships but are not independently subscribable channels. The
host owns persistence, action ordering, trigger evaluation, run claims, and run
history.

## State

`AutomationState.entries` contains the full `AutomationEntry` for
every visible automation, keyed by `resource`. Each entry contains the complete
definition, host-computed next scheduled run, a newest-first window of
`AutomationRunSummary` entries, and allowed operations.

An empty trigger list means manual-only. Schedule triggers use the portable
five-field AHP cron format plus an IANA time zone. Event triggers use a
host-defined type plus schema-defined configuration returned by
`listAutomationTriggerDefinitions`.

The session template can select a provider, model, and custom agent, and carries
the same schema-defined configuration values used for ordinary session
creation. Hosts revalidate all selections when a run starts.

## Subscription and reconnect

When `InitializeResult.automations` is present, clients subscribe to
`ahp-automations://`. The subscription returns the complete
`AutomationState` snapshot. Later catalogue changes use normal ordered
actions and therefore participate in reconnect replay. If replay is unavailable,
the host returns a fresh catalogue snapshot.

## Commands

Run and run-history commands use `channel: "ahp-automations://"` and carry the
target entry's identifier as `automation`.

- `runAutomation` idempotently creates a run by `requestId` and returns its
  `resource`.
- `fetchAutomationRuns` loads older summaries and publishes the updated full
  entry through `automation/set`.
- `listAutomationTriggerDefinitions` returns host trigger schemas.

## Actions

- `automation/createRequested` asks the host to persist a complete definition
  at a client-chosen `resource` (client-dispatchable).
- `automation/updateRequested` asks the host to apply a definition patch
  in action order (client-dispatchable).
- `automation/set` adds or replaces one full `AutomationEntry` by `resource`
  (server-only).
- `automation/removed` permanently deletes one entry by `resource`
  (client-dispatchable or server-originated).

The host sequences all actions on `ahp-automations://`.

Create and update requests are side-effect-only: their reducers leave catalogue
state unchanged. The host validates and persists the requested mutation, then
publishes the resulting full `AutomationEntry` through `automation/set`. A
rejected request carries `ActionEnvelope.rejectionReason` and produces no
catalogue mutation.

The host applies accepted update patches to its current authoritative
definition in action order. Omitted fields remain unchanged, so disjoint
patches compose. If accepted actions replace the same field, the later action
in server order wins. The host MUST reject an action that is unauthorized, is
not permitted by the current operations, or is invalid for the current
definition.

Before dispatching `automation/removed`, a client SHOULD verify that the target
advertises `AutomationOperation.Remove`. The host MUST revalidate the operation
and the client's authorization. If removal is no longer allowed, the host
rejects the action with `ActionEnvelope.rejectionReason`; the originating client
restores its optimistic removal. An accepted action permanently deletes the
automation before it is echoed to catalogue subscribers. Removing an unknown
resource is an idempotent no-op.

## Scheduling

Scheduling belongs to the host. A schedule contains exactly five cron fields
(`minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`) and an IANA time zone. The
portable grammar supports wildcards, values, inclusive ranges,
comma-separated lists, and steps over wildcards or ranges. It does not support
seconds, years, macros, or Quartz extensions. See the
[Automations guide](/guide/automations#scheduled-triggers) for the complete
grammar and day-field semantics.

`enabled` controls automatic triggers only; manual runs remain available when
the operation is advertised. A host atomically associates a scheduled
occurrence with at most one run.

## Security

Definitions contain no credentials or durable permission grants. The host
authorizes every operation and revalidates session configuration at execution
time.
